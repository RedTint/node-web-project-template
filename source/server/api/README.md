# API Folder
- This is a template for APIs when used along with this NODE Template.
- Architecture is just a recommended setup. You can decide to not use this folder or change the structure.

# Folders
- database - contains all database related scripts: model, repositories.
- routes - contain all route declarations. (e.g: app.get('/api/getProjects', service.getProjects))
