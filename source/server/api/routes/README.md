# API Routes Folder
Contains API-specific routes only

### Files
- example-routes.js - declares the route for a specific service. In this case we just returned data directly from the example. We would like you to define you own API structure (e.g: Repository Pattern).
- routes.js - this file consolidates all route declarations enabling `/server/app.js` to simply pass the `express` instance.
